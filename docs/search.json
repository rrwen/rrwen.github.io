The package contains an implementation of the Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) algorithm used for assigning the cause of death from Verbal Autopsy (VA) with methods from Miasnikof et al (2015).\nnbc4va complements the openVA suite of tools, as part of the Bloomberg Philanthropies Data for Health Initiative, and was developed for a published co-authored paper by Jha et al (2019) in BMC Medicine, where we examined six statistical algorithms for assigning the cause for 9374 deaths in India.\nThe package is maintained and available at:\ncran.r-project.org/package=nbc4va"
